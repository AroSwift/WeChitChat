# Description

WeChitChat is a safe place for kids to chat with their friends, and is completely free. We help provide a safe environment for your child by blocking bad words, monitoring, and allow parental controls. WeChitChat is happily brought to you by Aaron Barlow who is 14. I built this site in 7 months, spending 4 hours a day, to make it one of the safest places for kids to chat.

# Why?

I was not allowed to have a Facebook when I was 13 so I built WeChitChat to communicate with friends from all over the world. In some ways, WeChitChat is superior to Facebook, mainly the option to add parental control for kids who want to safely communicate with friends online.
